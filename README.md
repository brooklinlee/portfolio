## About Me

Hello! My name is Brooklin Lee, and I am a recently graduated Software Engineer with a background in entrepreneurship and social media management. I recently completed an intensive 12-week Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, where I honed my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, React, and various frameworks and services such as Node.js and Express.js.

During this program, I had the amazing opportunity to build a range of projects with a wide variety of languages and frameworks. I want to show them off to you!

One of the most satisfying things in life is being able to look at all of the projects that you have created and see how you have improved over time. I am excited to have this portfolio to look back on projects that I am proud of and to be able to add new projects to it in the future as I continuously hone my coding abilities.

Take a look at my portfolio today, and email me if you have any ideas for projects that I can build in the future!
